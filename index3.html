<p class="para3">The main function of Power amplifiers (also known as large signal amplifiers) is to deliver power,
 which as we know from above, is the product of the voltage and current applied to the load.
 The power amplifier works on the basic principle of converting the DC power drawn from the power supply into an AC voltage signal delivered to the load.
 Although the amplification is high the efficiency of the conversion from the DC power supply input to the AC voltage signal output is usually poor. 
The perfect or ideal amplifier would give us an efficiency rating of 100% or at least the power IN is equal to the power OUT. However,
 this can never happen as some of its power is lost in the form of heat and also, the amplifier itself consumes power during the amplification process. 
Then the efficiency of an amplifier is given as </p>
